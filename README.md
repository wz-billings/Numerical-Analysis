# Numerical-Analysis
All of my MATLAB codes for Numerical Analysis (MATH 441 at WCU)

Example Hws contains all of the scripts I have written for my homeworks for Numerical Analysis. These typically use the method functions I have written to solve homework problems.

Methods: contains all of the MATLAB functions I wrote to employ different methods for numerical analysis.
This currently only contains root-finding methods but will probably be subdivided in the future.
